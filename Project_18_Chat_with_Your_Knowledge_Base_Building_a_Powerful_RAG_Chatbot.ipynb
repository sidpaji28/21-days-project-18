            "    *   **Coverage:** It offers a health cover of up to ₹5 lakh (approximately $6,000 USD) per family per year for cashless and paperless treatment at empanelled public and private hospitals across India.\n",

Over time, this can damage arteries, leading to serious health problems like heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and vision loss. It\\'s often called the \"silent killer\" because it usually has no symptoms.\\n    *   **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Means there isn\\'t enough force to deliver blood effectively, which can cause dizziness, fainting, and in severe cases, organ damage.\\n\\n### How is it Measured?\\n\\nBlood pressure is typically measured using a **sphygmomanometer** (blood pressure cuff). The cuff is wrapped around your upper arm and inflated to temporarily stop blood flow. As the cuff slowly deflates, a healthcare professional (or a digital monitor) listens for or detects the sounds of blood flowing through the artery to determine the systolic and diastolic pressures.\\n\\nRegular blood pressure checks are crucial for monitoring your cardiovascular health and detecting potential issues early.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--1f2df6c0-18e2-4f65-9938-7764a7eb373a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6, 'output_tokens': 1457, 'total_tokens': 1463, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 879}})"
